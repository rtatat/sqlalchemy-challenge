In this scenario, I am going on vacation to Hawaii and have decided to do a climate analysis of the area. This will involve the completion of two major tasks:
1. Analysing the Climate Data
    Using SQLAlchemy queries, Pandas and Matplotlib, a basic climate analysis will be done. This will involve the analysis of precipitation data, over the last 12 months of the dataset, and plotting them onto a graph. The weather stations themselves will be analysed as well. The most active weather station will be determined, and the minimum, average and maximum temperatures. Another graph will be plotted to get the frequency of temperatures observed in the last 12 months.
2. Designing a Climate App
    A Flask API will be designed based on the climate data information obtained so far. The routes to be designed match the climate data analysis conducted in part 1. JSON lists will be returned of each of the different outcomes of the routes.
